# Hello World Repository üåç

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A curated, ever-expanding collection of "Hello, World!" programs written in as many programming languages as possible.

This repository serves as a linguistic museum, a programmer's curiosity cabinet, and a testament to the incredible diversity and creativity of language design throughout computing history.

## Project Description

The "Hello, World!" program is the traditional first step for programmers learning a new language. This project aims to document this simple ritual across a vast array of languages, from the most popular and practical to the most obscure and esoteric.

**Goals:**
*   To create a canonical reference for the "Hello, World!" program.
*   To showcase the syntactic and paradigmatic differences between languages.
*   To preserve examples from historical and lesser-known languages.
*   To have fun exploring the far reaches of programming language design.

## How to Use

*   **For Learners:** Browse the examples to get a feel for a new language's syntax before diving in.
*   **For the Curious:** Explore the `esoteric/` directory to see how programming concepts can be pushed to their limits.
*   **For Contributors:** See the [Contributing](#contributing) section below to add a new language.

## Contributing

Contributions are **extremely welcome**! This project thrives on community input.

**Want to add a language?** Please follow these steps:

1.  **Check for Existence:** Ensure the language is not already included in the main list above or in the repository's file structure.
2.  **Verify Correctness:** The program should be the simplest, most idiomatic way to print "Hello, World!" (or the equivalent) to standard output.
3.  **Create a Pull Request:**
    *   Add your `hello_world.{ext}` file to the most appropriate directory (e.g., `functional/`, `esoteric/`). Create a new directory if a suitable one doesn't exist.
    *   **Update this `README.md`** file by adding the language name to the list in the [Languages Featured](#languages-featured) section. Please keep the list alphabetical within its category.
    *   In your PR description, please include a brief description of the language and a link to its official website or repository.

**Guidelines:**
*   Please ensure the code is clean and well-commented if the syntax is unusual.
*   For esoteric languages, a brief explanation of how the code works is appreciated.
*   Only submit code that you write yourself or have the right to 

## Acknowledgments

*   This project is inspired by the countless "Hello, World!" collections and language lists across the internet.
*   Thanks to all the creators of the programming languages featured here.
