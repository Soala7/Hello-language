// A fragment shader that colors everything "Hello, World!"-yellow.
// This is a vast simplification; you can't just print text easily.
void main() {
    gl_FragColor = vec4(1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0); // Yellow
}
// (This is a cheat. True "Hello, World!" in graphics involves rendering text, which is complex.)
